# 📞 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)

## 📌 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to predict whether a telecom customer is likely to leave (churn) or stay with the company using machine learning techniques.

This helps businesses improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.
